This project is a data analysis of biker sales using Microsoft Excel by Alex the Analyst YouTube Channel.

## What’s inside?
- Cleaned raw data structured for analysis.
- Pivot tables to summarize sales by region, product, and time.
- An interactive dashboard with slicers and charts for insights.


## Questions(KPIs)
•	Who buys more bikes: married or single customers?
•	How do sales differ between men and women?
•	What is the average age of customers making purchases?
•	Is there a correlation between education level and bike purchases?
•	Which age group purchases the most bikes?
